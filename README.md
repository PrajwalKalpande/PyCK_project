# PyCK_project
## Alphabet Recognition using CNN
The program recognizes that written letter and also recommends movie or song name that start with the letter that we wrote in air by voice as well as text written
on a window(with random images (in case of movies) and genre related images (in case of songs) in the background)
### Code Requirements :
This code is in Python (version 3.6 or higher). If you have lower version of Python can upgrade using the pip package .

To install the required Packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository.
Copy paste this and type in command prompt:
> pip install -r requirements.txt

### Data Description :
The "Extended Hello World" of object recognition for machine learning and deep learning is the EMNIST dataset for handwritten letters recognition. It is an extended version of the MNIST dataset. We also used csv files containing data about movies and songs.
*How to run the code* :

Model is trained in CNN_Model_Builder.ipynb

Movies data is titles.csv

Song data is songs.csv

To run the model, just run alphabet_recognition.ipynb

choose movie or song by double clicking on option

then choose which movie or which song do you want by double clicking.
